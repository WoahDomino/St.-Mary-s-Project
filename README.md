St.-Mary-s-Project
==================

The programming end of my capstone project through the English and Computer Science departments

UPDATE: 3-16-14
Quite a lot of work has been done since my last commit on this.  Getting pushed today is my algorithm as it stands (SMP2.py), my XML database of blogs (FoodBlogDatabase.xml), the script I wrote to convert that XML file into a list of Blog objects and pickle it (Database Script.py and save.p), and the rough draft of my paper along with any other data that needs to go into it.

In the foulder with my rough draft are some visual representations of my Blog objects and the shape of the data the reccomender system returns over time.  

To come: 
* My other 20 page paper on the english side of things
* Proper citations.  As a note this paper is a draft.  Nothing is cited properly yet, but will be soon. 
* A GUI for the algorithm... this involves either teaching myself how to use Django or Flask.  While Django seems fun, Flask seems a little more lightweight and in tune with what I need to do.
